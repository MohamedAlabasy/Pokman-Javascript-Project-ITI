The task is to make this ball move in all directions of the screen using playing arrows,  
when it hits one side of the screen it goes back inside again,  
If the user presses the ESC button, the ball stops moving and turns into the solid shape,  
and when user press again on the arrows, it returns to the movement and changes its shape according to its direction.
